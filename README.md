# hello-world

My name is not Buddy! And it's not Incrediboy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help, and what did you say to me?
"Fly home, Buddy. I work alone."
It tore me apart. But I learned that you can't trust anyone, especially your heroes.
I was wrong to treat you that way. I'm sorry.
See, now you respect me. Because I'm a threat. That's the way it works.
